# Introduction to R - course information

## Purpose of the course

The goal of this course is to provide an accessible entry into the world of R which prepares the participants to confidently approach the most common analysis tasks using R. This includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, creating visualizations or writing entire academic papers using RMarkdown. Unfortunately R has a reputation for a steep learning curve, but I aim to dispel this myth and show how a range of recent developments make R not just powerful, but more accessible to newcomers.
 

## Key topics covered

The guiding logic of the course is to give practical knowledge for the whole data analysis workflow:

1. Importing data (Monday)
2. Data wrangling/cleaning (Tuesday)
3. Visualization / Exploratory analysis (Wednesday)
4. Analysis / Writing our own functions (Thursday)
5. Reporting the results (Friday)

R can read in basically any file format and we will cover a range of the most commonly used types, including plain txt, csv, Excel xlsx, Stata, Sas, and SPSS. Reflecting on the realities of the usual research projects, the course focuses on data cleaning and getting the data in the proper shape where we can analyze and visualize it properly. The exploratory analysis and data visualization parts are heavily intertwined. We will learn how to make descriptive statistics, how to group data, and explore a given dataset. The whole course is heavily infused with visualization components and we will be learning to use the ggplot2 package to produce wonderful looking graphs (as an example, most of the Financial Times' charts are made with R in ggplot2). 

As part of learning a programming language, it is inevitable that we have to learn how to write our own functions. It is not the most intuitive part, and I will focus on making it as accessible as possible without relying on too much of the computer science/programming jargon. Alongside with this we will also look at a few statistical applications in R (t-test and OLS regression). At the end of the course we will export our results from R or even write an academic paper or report using RMarkdown. 

## How the course will work online

Thankfully, R (and programming in general) is one of the subjects that can work well in a purely online setting (for teaching and learning). During the course we will use the Google Colab for an interactive learning environment. For this you'll need a Google account. As part of our online communication, we will be using Slack for instant messaging and generally just to keep in touch and facilitate discussions and Q&A. The live element of the class for the week is around 10 hours total: this includes live coding, Q&A with the instructor and the TA, coffee breaks and getting to know each other.

The particpants will receive coding challanges that they can work through using the knowledge from the "live" parts and afterwards if needed we can discuss solutions during the live sessions. 


## Prerequisites for the Course (if any)

The course is designed without assuming any programming knowledge (R or other language). The only thing needed is a Google account.
