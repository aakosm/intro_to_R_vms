```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

In this reprt we investigate the possible connection between life expectancy and GDP per capita. To illustrate our point we will plot the correlation.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)


ggplot(data = gapminder,
       mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                     y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_point()
```
