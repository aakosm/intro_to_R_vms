Some tips for using RStudio:

* Under `Tools -> Global Options` you can change the following:  

    + `Code -> Editing -> Soft wrap R source files` If you check this, the lines in your script file do not run “out of the window”.
    + `Appearance`: You can select your colour scheme here. If you stare at the screen for a long time, white text against a darker background might be less hard on the eyes.
    + You should also disable the **"Restore most recently opened project at startup"** and **"Restore .RData ino workspace at startup"**, 
    + set **"Save workspace to .RData on exit"** to **Never** in `Tools -> Global Options -> General`
